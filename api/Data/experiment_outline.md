# Experiment Outline

## Introduction

Welcome to your new experiment! This Markdown file serves as a starting point to document and discuss your experimental process. You can overwrite this file with your own content, following the structure that suits your project best.

## Experiment Structure
```
The Experiment class represents a single experiment configured by the user.
It's initialized with an absolute path to the experiment's directory, which
should contain all the information necessary to construct an experiment
instance, which should then be able to run the experiment with a variety of
user-specified parameters.

The basic structure of an experiment directory looks like this:

.
└── MyExperiment/
    ├── Models/
    │   ├── alexnet.pt
    │   └── vgg.pth
    ├── Datasets/
    │   ├── testset_as_directory/
    │   │   ├── hotdog.jpg
    │   │   ├── not_a_hotdog.jpg
    │   │   └── labels.txt
    │   ├── testset_as_file.csv
    │   └── testset_as_getter.py

    │   │   ├── .python-version
    │   └── Type2/
    │       └── ...
    ├── README.md
    └── experimentconfig.yaml

Models/ (directory)
-------------------
    Contains all the models available for use in the experiment,
    stored as PyTorch .pt or .pth files.

Datasets/ (directory)
---------------------
    Contains all the datasets available for use in the experiment,
    stored as one of the following:
        - a directory of files along with a labels.txt
            or labels.csv file
        - a single file containing all the data, (tabular data)
        - a python script that returns a dataset in one of the
            above formats (e.g. a script that downloads a dataset)

Output/ (directory)
-------------------
    Contains all the output files generated by the experiment.

NodeTypes/ (directory)
----------------------
    Contains subdirectories outlining the different types of nodes
    available for use in the experiment (e.g., "Client", "Server").
    Each subdirectory contains the following components:
        - main.py
            The main runtime script for the node.
        - src/ (directory)
            A directory containing all the custom modules used by
            the node.
        - requirements.txt
            A list of dependencies for the node, which will be used
            to create a virtual environment for the node.
        - .python-version
            A file containing the python version to use for the
            node's virtual environment.

README.md
---------
    A markdown file containing a description of the experiment.
    When an experiment directory is first created, this file contains
    a template for the user to fill out, as well as a description of
    the experiment's directory structure, much like this one.

experimentconfig.yaml
---------------------
    A file containing the experiment's configuration, which can be
    modified by the user.

Note that participating devices must have the following dependencies
installed to properly run experiments:
    pyenv
        allows the experiment to enforce a specific python version
    venv
        allows the experiment to create a virtual environment on the
        device
```
## Editing this File

Overwrite the content in this file to suit your experiment. Here are some sections you might consider including:

### Experiment Purpose

What are the objectives of this experiment? What are you trying to achieve or understand?

### Methodology

What processes and techniques are you using in this experiment? What steps will you follow?

### Results

What were the outcomes of your experiment? Did you achieve your objectives? What data did you collect?

### Conclusion

What are your final thoughts on the experiment? What did you learn? How could you apply this knowledge in the future?

Remember, this structure is just a suggestion. Feel free to adapt it as necessary to document your work effectively.
