# A script that wraps the tracr application (app.py) to accomplish
# the following:
#      - The user can run the setup sequence by invoking the "tracr" command
#        without worrying about manual environment setup first
#      - tracr itself (app.py) runs inside an ephemeral Docker container that
#        simply passes the user's arguments to app.py
#      - The user can run the "tracr" command from any directory as if it's a
#        locally-installed executable
#
# If the first and only positional argument is "setup", then the script will
# run the setup sequence. Otherwise, the script will run the tracr application
# with the given arguments.
